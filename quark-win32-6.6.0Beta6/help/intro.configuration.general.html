<i>Select 3D viewer</i>&nbsp;. If you have a 3Dfx-compatible 3D-acceleration
graphics card, an OpenGL-compatible 3D-acceleration graphics card, or a DirectX
3D-acceleration graphics card installed, QuArK can use it to speed up drawing
in all windows. If you don't have one or neither of those work correctly, you
can default to Software 3D rendering. Also, other renderers have more features
than the Software 3D.
</p><p><i>Position/size of window</i>&nbsp;. The position and size of the floating 3D-
windows. The first two numbers are the X and Y positions of the window, counted
in pixels from the upper left corner of the screen. The last two numbers are the
width and height of the window, also counted in pixels.
</p><p><i>Entities in 3D</i>&nbsp;. Whether or not QuArK should draw entities (3D-models) in
the 3D-windows.
</p><p><i>&quot;Far&quot; distance</i>&nbsp;. How deep QuArK should draw in the 3D-windows. Lower
values will speed up drawing.
</p><p><i>Fade density</i>&nbsp;. The lower the fading fog, the more you can see, but keep in
mind that the <b>&quot;Far&quot; distance</b> and the <b>fade density</b> are somewhat
connected.
</p><p><i>Vertical view angle</i>&nbsp;. The field of view of the perspective views, in
degrees. Just as with cameras expected it is not the width but the height of
the view that you enter.
</p><p><i>Fade color</i>&nbsp;. Want green fading fog? Change it here!
</p><p><i>Frame color</i>&nbsp;. The color to use on the bounding area of the 3D-windows,
where QuArK won't draw due to the choosen size of the view.
</p><p><i>Texture max-dimension</i>&nbsp;. The maximum width and height of a texture. Software
and 3Dfx are limited to a maximum of 256, but this is looked after automatically
by QuArK. Also, if you set it too high, QuArK will automatically scale back.
</p>
<p><u>Mouse sensitivity</u>
</p><p>All these values controls the mouse sensitivity, when you use your mouse to
move around in the 3D-windows.
To reverse the direction of any of these settings just change the value to a negative.
</p>
<p><u>Keyboard settings</u>
</p><p>Instead of using the mouse to move around with (which can be quite difficult at
times), you can either use these standard movement-keys when the 3D-window is
active, or redefine them to suit your needs. It is <u>highly recommended</u>
that you know how to move around in 3D-window using the keys.
</p>
<p><u>Keyboard movement dynamics</u>
</p><p>Change these values if you feel, that moving around using the keys, isn't quite
fast or slow enough. You must experiment a bit to find a setting that you like
using.
</p>
<p><u>Additional settings</u>
</p><p><i>The next time...</i>&nbsp;. Enables or disables the warning box that shows up when you
open the 3D-windows for the first time.
</p><p><i>Close views when the game is run</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, QuArK will close any
3D-windows and multi-pages panels open when the game is run using the menu. This
will reduce the amount of resources QuArK uses, so the game runs more smoothly.
</p><p><i>Close views when the configurations are changed</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, QuArK will
close any 3D-windows and multi-pages panels open when the configurations are
changed. This will prevent any of the new settings from not correctly being
applied to views that are already open.
</p><p><i>Allow multiple 3D windows</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, clicking the 3D button will open new
floating 3D windows. When disabled, clicking the 3D button will just toggle one view
open/closed. Opening more than several windows will slow QuArK down, so use multiple
windows with care!

You might need to enable lighting in order for transparency to be applied.
</p><p><i>Lighting</i>&nbsp;. With this you can enable and disable the lighting.
</p>
<p><u>Additional options</u>
</p><p><i>Texture filtering</i>&nbsp;. This improved the texture quality, mainly under
high angles. It will make the textures appear less blocky and pixelated.
The higher the settings, the better the quality, but also the lower the
performance.
</p><p><i>Double buffering</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, OpenGL will render the image
offscreen, and then copy it. This will prevent any weird triangular
flickering from the rendering being visible.
</p><p><i>Color dithering</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, OpenGL will dither colors.
</p><p><i>'Supports GDI' flag</i>&nbsp;. This will enabled the 'Supports GDI' flag.
</p><p><i>Over-the-scene lines+icons</i>&nbsp;. This will draw all the lines and
icons over the scene.
</p><p><i>Color bits</i>&nbsp;. The amount of bits per pixel. The higher the number,
the better colors will look. Not all numbers are supported. 16, 24 and
32 are common numbers these days.
</p><p><i>Depth buffer bits</i>&nbsp;. The amount of bits per pixel in the depth
buffer. The higher the number, the less chance of objects being rendered
overlapping while they're not. Not all numbers are supported. 16 is the
most common number these days.
</p><p><i>Size correction</i>&nbsp;. Corrects misalignments between the image and the
wireframe lines over it. For example, Windows NT's software OpenGL is
known to require a correction of about 0.92 instead of 1; otherwise, the
textured images are smaller than the wireframes.
</p><p><i>Display lists</i>&nbsp;. When enabled, OpenGL will use display lists.
Display lists speed up rendering. However, slight slowdowns might be
noticed when changes to the map/model are made, because the lists then
need to be rebuild with the updated information.
</p><p><i>Face culling</i>&nbsp;. Speeds up rendering by making all the backsides of
faces invisible. This doesn't apply to transparent faces.
</p><p><i>Ambient lighting brightness</i>&nbsp;. The ambient lighting brightness. The
higher the number, the brighter the ambient lighting. Settings this high
enough prevents the scene from being black at places where there are no
lights.
</p><p><i>Lighting quality on faces</i>&nbsp;. This determines how segmented a face can
become when lighting is applied to it. The more segments per face, the
smoother the lighting will look, at the cost of rendering speed.
</p><p><i>Lighting quality when not moving</i>&nbsp;. This is the lighting quality that
OpenGL will use when the camera is not moving. This option only has effect
when Lighting is enabled. There are three options:<br>
OpenGL lighting, which uses OpenGL's internal lighting routines.<br>
Basic lighting, which uses QuArK's software lighting.<br>
No lighting, which will disable lighting.<br>
</p><p><i>Lighting quality while moving</i>&nbsp;. Same as 'Lighting quality when not
moving', but now when moving the camera. Rendering light can take much
time, especially in larger scenes with many lights. Disabling lighting
when moving will speed up rendering when the camera is moving, and thus
make the movement much less jerky.
</p><p>Note: Use a utility like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realtech-vr.com/glview/">OpenGL Viewer</a>
to make sure your video card and video drivers support all the OpenGL
features QuArK needs.

conversions are done automatically (e.g. if you leave the .wal box empty but
fill the .bmp box, when you want to edit a Quake 2 texture (.wal), QuArK will
convert it to .bmp, call your program, and convert it back to .wal after you
edited the image).

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br>
Windows 98SE, ME, 2k, XP (and presumably above) have the ability to utilize 
more than 1 display adapter (video card or inbuilt video chip) and, in some 
cases, more than 1 monitor on 1 display adapter (often called a dualhead 
display adapter), at any one time. This means that with appropriate 
hardware, you can your desktop spread over 2 or more monitors. This is 
particularly useful for CAD-style applications such as QuArK as you can 
have your main display filled with the drawing area whilst you can push 
toolbars, texture windows, guide images, compile messages, chat windows, 
tutorial documents, other graphics programs and the like on your secondary 
monitors. Note that having multiple monitors will increase the strain on 
your computer so you should have a reasonably fast computer to begin with 
(you probably shouldn't try doing this on anything slower than 300MHz if 
you're running things that are straining the CPU already for instance). 
Also note that not all programs like running on secondary monitors. 
Anything that docks (such as ICQ) may refuse to move into the secondary 
monitors and many overlay-based programs such as TV tuner programs may 
behave unusually or run with very high CPU usage on secondary monitors. And 
of course, anything that uses the video card's special ability such as 3D 
acceleration, inbuilt TV capture overlay or 3DVR will only work on the 
display adapter that has that capability.
</p>
<p><strong>LAPTOPS (98SE/ME/2k/XP):</strong></br>
If your computer is a laptop, it must have a video chip that is itself 
capable of running 2 monitors (a chip with dualhead capabilities). Examples 
include the Trident Cyberblade, ATI Rage Mobility M1 (P series only for 
Win98SE/ME) and the nVidia GeForce2Go and GeForce 4 440Go/420Go. In the 
case of a laptop, one screen will be the internal flat panel display and 
one screen will be a monitor plugged into the video out port. You can tell 
if your laptop supports multimonitor setups by right clicking on the 
desktop, selecting properties then clicking the settings tab. If you get 2 
screens (1 will be grayed out) then your video chip supports multimonitors. 
If this is not the case, try it with the newest drivers you can find, 
either from the maker of the laptop or from the maker of the video chip 
that the laptop uses. Note that for some reason, this multi monitor ability 
is rarely advertised in the laptop manual or promotional material. If your 
laptop's inbuilt display adapter doesn't support multiple monitors or you 
want to run 3 screens and you have a PCI docking station, you can often 
still run multiple monitors by using a PCI video card in the docking 
station, in similar way to a desktop as outlined below. Examples of laptops 
where this has been reported to work include the Dell Latitude series with 
PCI docking stations.
</p>
<p><strong>DESKTOPS:</strong><br>
If your computer is a standard desktop, you can put in additional PCI video 
cards and attach additional monitors to them (note that not all PCI video 
cards support multiple monitors and a lot of the ones that do have problems 
with Windows 2000/XP - see below). In fact, you can get dual head PCI video 
cards such as some with the GeForce2MX chipset and some earlier Matrox 
video cards. Note that the drivers that ship with Windows will almost never 
work in multimonitor setups, you'll need to download new drivers from the 
maker (which can get tricky if the maker no longer exists, in which case 
try places like <a href="http://www.driverguide.com">www.driverguide.com</a>
which carry archives). Also note that these discussions apply for dualhead 
cards where you wish to run 3 or more monitors (ie. you'll need another 
card anyway). If you have a dualhead card and only want to run 2 monitors, 
follow the instructions that came with the card ;-)
</p>
<p>DESKTOPS - WINDOWS 98SE/ME:
Under Windows 98 and ME, the display adapter that will drive your primary 
display (the one that 3D games will drop into for instance) is the display 
adapter that your BIOS screen boots on. You can select this normally in the 
PnP section of your BIOS (yes its a weird place to put it but that's where 
its put usually). Look for an option that you can toggle from PCI to AGP. 
In most cases, you will want to leave this as AGP. When you get into 
Windows, simply install the drivers for your other cards as you would 
normally, reboot and the next time you go into Windows you should see in 
the settings tab of the display properties aplet one or more grayed out 
screens which you can enable using the 'extend desktop' check box. Once 
enabled, you can drag the screens around in the aplet to match your 
physical configuration.
</p>
<p>DESKTOPS - WINDOWS 2K/XP:
Under Windows 2000 (and presumably XP), you can switch your primary display 
adapter on the fly so you don't need to boot off the display adapter that 
you wish to run your 3D games and single monitor applications on. However, 
there is a different problem, being that there are very few older PCI video 
cards that Windows 2000 and XP can initialize after bootup (Microsoft's 
knowledge base unhelpfully states that the video card needs to have a 
'disable VGA' switch and you need to turn this off - I've only seen 1 video 
card with this, a Matrox MGA-2064W, and it only works with this switch 
ON!). As a result, generally you will need to set a PCI video card to boot 
in the BIOS then get Windows 2000 to initialize your AGP video card once 
the desktop appears.
</p><p>If you want a 3rd monitor or if you must boot off your AGP card (for 
instance your BIOS doesn't allow you to change it, as is common on 
motherboards with onboard display adapters), you will need to find a video 
card that supports Windows 2000 dual monitors. Examples include Matrox 
video cards and newer nVidia-based video cards. Once you've found a 
combination of video cards that works, you can install them then use the 
'extend desktop' check box in the settings tab of the display properties 
aplet to enable them. Again, once enabled you can drag the screens around 
in the aplet to match your physical configuration. Also note that there is 
a 'primary monitor' check box which you use to select which monitor will 
show single-monitor mode programs such as 3D games.
