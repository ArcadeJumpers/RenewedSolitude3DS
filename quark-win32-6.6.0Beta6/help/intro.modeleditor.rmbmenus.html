<p>There are a number of <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB menus</a> that apply specifically to the <a href="glossary.html#t">Tree-view</a> and are pretty
well self explanatory so we will only cover a couple of them that need it.
</p><p><img border=1 align=right src="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.treeviewrmbmenus1.png">
</p><p><i>Expand Sub-items </i>&nbsp;: This will expand all of this items sub-folders and their sub-folders on down.
</p><p><i>Auto Frame Renaming </i>&nbsp;:Some models consist of more then one component. If so, their frame names
should always match. When checked, if a frame of one component is renamed, this will cause the same frame
of all the other related components to be renamed also automatically.
</p><p><i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause any vertex to <a href="glossary.html#s">snap</a> to the nearest location on
the editor's grid.
</p><p><i>Cut </i>&nbsp;: Cut the selection to the clipboard.
</p><p><i>Copy </i>&nbsp;: Copy the selection to the clipboard.
</p><p><i>Paste </i>&nbsp;: Paste a model object from the clipboard.
</p><p><i>Duplicate </i>&nbsp;: This makes a copy of the selected object(s), but not all of them.
Primarily components and frames, it gives each new item its own name by adding the next
numerical sequence of its group. With frames it drops it at the end of its group.
This avoids errors with other functions. Also handles skins, but no renaming,
and multiple items, even in different groups and components.
</p><p><i>Delete </i>&nbsp;: Delete the selection.
</p><p><i>Show Component </i>&nbsp;: This works in conjunction with the <a href="glossary.html#h">Hide Component</a> function below.
It will redisplay the selected model component in the editor's view and cause it to become active again.
</p><p><i>Hide Component </i>&nbsp;: This works in conjunction with the <a href="glossary.html#s">Show Component</a> function above.
When the selected model component is in this state it will not be drawn in the editor's view and becomes
inactive for various functions.
</p><p><i>Save Skin File </i>&nbsp;: Opens a file save window and allows you to save the selected skin as various
types of image files.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>NOTE</u></b>: You can NOT save another type as a .pcx 
file because they do not have a <a href="glossary.html#p">palette</a> like .pcx files do, this will only cause an error.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You CAN save a .pcx file to another file type like .tga though.
</p><p><img border=1 align=right src="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.treeviewrmbmenus2.png">
</p><p><i>Match Frame Count </i>&nbsp;: This will duplicate the number of frames in the selected components with the one
that has the most frames in it. It will not copy the frames, only how many there are.
</p><p><i>Check Components </i>&nbsp;: This checks components for any errors in them that might exist. At this time just
for <a href="glossary.html#m">Match Frame Count</a> but more will be added in the future. However it does give more info about them.
</p><p><i>Duplicate Current Frame </i>&nbsp;: This copies a single frame that is currently selected and adds
that copy to that model component's animation frames list just below the frame being copied.
This can be used multiple times for the same single original frame. For multiple frame copies use the
<a href="glossary.html#d">Duplicate</a> function on the <a href="glossary.html#e">Edit</a> menu.
</p><p><i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.rmbmenus.html#viewsrmbmenus">Editor Views RMB menus</a> item.
Please click the menu link for a detail description and its use.
</p><p><i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the above <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB menu</a> item.
</p><p><i>Cut </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the above <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB menu</a> item.
</p><p><i>Copy </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the above <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB menu</a> item.
</p><p><i>Paste </i>&nbsp;: Performs the same as the above <a href="glossary.html#r">RMB menu</a> item.

<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
de-activated (in vertex mode) and select either the <a href="glossary.html#s">Skeleton</a> folder or a model component's <a href="glossary.html#f">Frames</a> folder
or at least one frame or bone within one of those folders, then this menu item will activate.
Individual items will become active on its sub-menu depending on your selections and cursor placement over a bone handle.
These are strictly bone related and are covered in detail below.
</p><p><i>Face Commands </i>&nbsp;: This is the link to the Face Commands sub-menu that will appear
when your courser is over it. To implement this menu you must have the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.display.html">Linear Drag Handles</a> button
activated (in face mode) and select at least one face in a model component, then this menu
item will appear. These are strictly face (triangle) related and are covered in detail below.

menu bar and are more Triangle related. These are also covered in detail below.
</p><p><i>Keyframe Commands </i>&nbsp;: Keyframe functions create additional animation frames for movement
between two selected frames.<br>
The number of additional frames to be created is the amount set on the
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#__top__">Animation toolbar</a>
<a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#ipf">IPF button</a> <b>- 1</b>.<br>
For example, if you want <b>3</b> fill frames added between the two selected keyframes,
set the <a href="intro.modeleditor.toolpalettes.animation.html#ipf">IPF button</a> to <b>4</b>.
To use these functions you must select two frames of the same component.
If they are not consecutive frames (one right after the other) then all frames in between the
two will be replaced with the newly created frames.
You can also select other components for their same frames to be included.
If a component has <a href="intro.modeleditor.editelements.html#tags">Tags</a>,
such as imported <a href="glossary.html#fileext">.md3</a> Quake3 models, all of its <b>related</b> imported components and
their tags will also be included without having to select them. But not all of the components
of that particular <a href="glossary.html#fileext">.md3</a> model that were imported separately. So be sure to select
those components also if you want them included.
They are strictly frame and component related and are covered in detail below.
</p><p><i>Bone Options </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with the Model Bone visual tools to work with.

</p><p><a name="autoframerenaming"></a>
<i>Auto Frame Renaming </i>&nbsp;:Some models consist of more then one component. If so, their frame names
should always match. When checked, if a frame of one component is renamed, this will cause the same frame
of all the other related components to be renamed also automatically.
</p><p><a name="reset3dview"></a>
<i>Reset 3D view </i>&nbsp;: If the model becomes 'lost', goes out of the 3D view, you can use this
function to reset the 3D view and bring the model back to its starting position when it was first opened
and based on the 'Rotation Method' you last chose to rotate the model by.
</p><p><a name="boundingboxes"></a>
<i>Draw Bounding Boxes </i>&nbsp;: When checked this activates the display of model bounding boxes if any.
Also known as <a href="glossary.html#h">hit boxes</a> for Half-Life and by other names for different model formats.
</p><p><a name="componentcolors"></a>
<i>Use Component Colors </i>&nbsp;: When checked this activates the display of individual component colors,
which can be set on the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#specsargsview">Specifics page</a>,
to distinguish one model component mesh area from another.
</p><p><a name="viewsettings"></a>
<u>Each view can be set to one of three rendering modes :</u>
</p><p><i>Wireframe </i>&nbsp;: The model mesh will be drawn as lines.
This is the fastest drawing-method of the model-views. 
</p><p><i>Solid </i>&nbsp;: Each model is drawn in a single, solid color or shades of that color.
This means that you won't be able to 'see-through' the model once it is in view.
</p><p><i>Textured </i>&nbsp;: The model is displayed with its full texture applied for the finished &quot;skinned&quot; look.
</p><p><a name="backgroundimage"></a>
<i>Background image... </i>&nbsp;: When selected, this will open a dialog box where you can choose any image
file the <a href="glossary.html#q">QuArK</a> supports to place and display in the 2D view that the cursor was in when the RMB was clicked.

</p><p><i>Assign \ Release BBox </i>&nbsp;: BBox is a polyhedron box that is called by different names and are used for different
things based on a game models format. Commonly it surrounds an area for a 'hitbox', 'collision', 'bounding box'...
When a BBox is selected and a RMB click on the center of a bone is made, then that BBox can be assigned to that bone, or
release from that bone if both have not already been assigned to something else that would cause a conflict.
To properly position the BBox on the bone, use its <a href="glossary.html#c">center handle</a> and drag it to the coords <a href="glossary.html#numbers">0,0,0</a>
in the editor's views <b>BEFORE</b> you assign it to a bone. Once assigned you can change the BBox size by
dragging its <a href="glossary.html#s">side handles</a>, the <a href="glossary.html#c">corner handles</a> will <b>NOT</b> hold its shape.
</p><p><i>Assign \ Release Vertices </i>&nbsp;: When vertices of a component are selected, RMB click on the center of a bone,
then click this item to assign them to, or release them from ,that bone. Combinations of both can be done at the same time.
</p><p><i>Set Handle Position </i>&nbsp;: Active when one or more vertexes are selected that are assigned to that bone handle.
Click this item to position and set that bone handle centered within those vertexes.
An 'offset' can also be applied to this setting.
</p><p><i>Select (bone handle name) Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes assigned to it,
click this item to select all of them from that bone's handle. Or, if another handle is attached that has the vertexes
assigned to it instead, then those are the vertexes that will be selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any
handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.
</p><p><i>Select (bone handle name) handle position Vertexes </i>&nbsp;: When the cursor is over a bone's Center handle with vertexes
assigned to it, click this item to select the vertexes used to set that bone's handle position. Or, if another handle is
attached that has the vertexes assigned to it instead, then those are the position vertexes for that handle that will be
selected. If no vertexes have been assigned to any handle at that location, then the menu item will show disabled.
</p><p><i>Add \ Remove Control </i>&nbsp;: This will add or remove a single bone controle, connected to the bone handle when the
<a href="glossary.html#r">RMB</a> was clicked in the editor's view.
</p><p><a name="bonesselection"></a>
<i>Individual Bones Selection </i>&nbsp;: (Unless a function specifically deals with all bones)
When this item is checked ONLY the INDIVIDUAL bone handles that are selected will be effected
and NOT any sub-bones that are NOT specifically selected, Which IS the case if this is un-checked.
</p><p><i>Handle Scaling </i>&nbsp;: These functions deal with setting the scale size of the bone handles for better work size.
These are covered in detail below. Click on this menu item, shown in blue above, to see the sub-menu and its items below.
</p><p><i>Show Bones </i>&nbsp;: This allows all bones to be displayed in the editor's views.
</p><p><i>Hide Bones </i>&nbsp;: This stops all bones from being displayed in the editor's views.
</p><p><i>Structure Bones </i>&nbsp;: When clicked this function will place all bones
inside their 'parent' bones in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>.
</p><p><i>Extract Bones </i>&nbsp;: When clicked this function will move all bones
outside of their 'parent' bones in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.dataforms.html#treeview">tree-view</a>.
</p><p><i>Force to grid </i>&nbsp;: This will cause a bone's center handle to <a href="glossary.html#s">snap</a> to the nearest location on the
editor's grid for the view that the RMB click was made in.

</p><p><i>Show selection in Skin-view </i>&nbsp;: Because the Skin-view and the rest of the editor views work independently,
this will pass selected editor model mesh triangle faces to the 'Skin-view' to be outlined and distinguish them. However,
it does not actually select them in the <a href="intro.modeleditor.skinview.html">Skin-view</a>. Any selections or deselections will
